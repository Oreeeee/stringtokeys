# String to keys
Simple Python app that writes on keyboard the string that you give it.

I created this to input long links faster on my virtual machines without guest additions.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Oreeeee/stringtokeys
cd stringtokeys
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
```stringtokeys.py [-h] -s USER_STRING [-w WAIT] [-d DELAY]```
